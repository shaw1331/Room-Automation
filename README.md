* Download the Zip file of the project to your local setup, and extract the full code directory from the zip file.
* The whole Room Automation directory consists of Arduino Code and website Code. 
* Open the Node Mcu code through your Arduino ide.
* Open the terminal.
* Go to the room automation directory.
* Install the node modules and other dependencies to the project through the command “npm install”.
* After the installation of all dependencies starts the local server by “npm start” command.
* Go to the Sinric pro website "https://sinric.pro/index.html".
* Complete the sign-up process through Email.
* Generate the app key and secret from there and add it to the Node MCU code as it will be required to establish the connection between the Node and Sinric pro website.
* Add the devices on the Sinric Pro website and add generated device id to the Node MCU code.
* Compile and upload the code to the Node MCU.
* Open the local server http://localhost:3000/.
* Login here with the Sinric pro credential. 
* In the dashboard tab, all the devices will be present. So you can able to control the state of the devices by clicking on the Turn on and Turn off button on the website.
